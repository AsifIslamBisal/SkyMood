üå§Ô∏è SkyMod

SkyMod is a modern, responsive weather application built with React that delivers real-time weather updates with an intuitive user experience. Leveraging the OpenWeather API, the app provides accurate details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city worldwide.

A key highlight of SkyMod is its dynamic background system ‚Äî the interface adapts in real-time with animated images and videos that change according to the current weather (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Snow, Thunderstorm, etc.) and time of day (Day/Night). This creates an engaging, visually appealing experience that makes weather tracking more interactive than ever.

With its clean UI, efficient state management, and seamless API integration, SkyMod demonstrates strong frontend development practices. The app is designed to be both functional and aesthetic, making weather monitoring simple yet visually immersive.

Status: The project is currently under development, with continuous improvements planned for design enhancements and extended features like multi-day forecasts and geolocation-based weather detection.
